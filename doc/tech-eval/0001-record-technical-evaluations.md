# 1. Record technical decisions

Date: 2024-08-22

## Status

Accepted

## Context

We need to record the technical decisions made on this project apart from the architectural decisions. If we have all of our decisions lumped into the ADR category, it's difficult to sift through what decisions impact the architecture vs what decisions are team standards or tooling decisions.

## Decision

We will use something similar to the Architecture Decision Records, as [described by Michael Nygard](http://thinkrelevance.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions). The primary difference is that these decisions do not directly impact the architecture of the code.

## Consequences

- Our documents will be easier to read through because they will be better organized
- There is a steeper learning curve for the engineers on the team
